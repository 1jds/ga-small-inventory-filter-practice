# General Assembly React Course: Small Inventory Filter Practice

This repo contains the code of my simple solution to an inventory filter/search task. This is practice using legacy React with class-based components and lifecycle methods.

Note that the button styles are adapted from [this website](https://getcssscan.com/css-buttons-examples). (I didn't come up with them from scratch.) I have then styled the product components to match with similar colors, styling, etc.

Below is a screenshot of the result running locally.
